Some folks think it's a weird compulsion he can't control, while others reckon it's because he's got this never-ending craving for gambling.",
        "Picture this: Slyde strolling through a busy market, looking all innocent, but his fingers are as quick as lightning, snatching coins, trinkets, or whatever catches his eye. He's known for taking things that nobody else could even dream of, like a goblin's dagger during a tricky negotiation or an enchanted amulet from a wizard's neck during a chat about magic stuff. Slyde's slick moves have made him the talk of the town, and not in a good way.",
        "But what makes Slyde even more legendary is how he talks his way out of the messes he gets into. Whether he's caught red-handed with a noble's stolen jewel or caught cheating at cards, Slyde's got a story for every occasion. Once, he convinced a group of goblins that he was their king, and they actually crowned him before he made his escape.",

But it's not just his deadly accuracy that sets him apart; Paelias is convinced that lurking monsters are everywhere, from the shadowy forest to the bottom of his tankard. In fact, he once shot an innocent mushroom, fearing it might be a fungal infiltrator. Beware, for his crossbow deals d6 damage wherever he goes, be it at the dinner table or on the dance floor.",
        "As a cleric, Paelias channels divine magic for the gods, but his prayers often sound more like negotiations. He's as greedy as a dragon when it comes to treasure, ready to trade even his elven dignity for a shiny bauble. In fact, he once offered to heal a goblin's sore ankle in exchange for a particularly sparkly rock.",
        "Paelias is a crucial member of the Rusty Saw, a band of adventurers who double as musicians. He's the one in the back with a crossbow at the ready and a trombone slung over his shoulder, just in case the monsters break out into song. In the world of Dungeons and Dragons, Paelias is the paranoid, treasure-hungry cleric with a crossbow that deals d6 damage and a heart that gleams like a dragon's horde."
